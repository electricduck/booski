## ‚ú® Quick Start

>  This Quick Start makes general assumptions about your environment, such as using Linux (x86_64). For a more comprehensive guide, see [Getting Started](https://github.com/electricduck/booski/wiki/Getting-Started).

```sh
cd ~/.local/bin
wget https://github.com/electricduck/booski/releases/download/v%2F0.x%2F0.4-rc1/booski-0.4-rc1-linux-x64.bin
chmod +x booski-0.4-rc1-linux-x64.bin
./booski-0.4-rc1-linux-x64.bin start --no-daemon
```

## üèóÔ∏è Building

This repository currently houses two tangenically related projects (under `./src`): the Bluesky cross-poster (`Booski`), and a general-purpose Bluesky library (`Booski.Lib`).

> For some background, Booski began life as a Bluesky library. Shortly into development, these plans folded as maitaining a library (especially for an ever-evolving unstable API) is a hard task at scale and [another, more feature-complete, Bluesky library already exists](https://github.com/drasticactions/FishyFlip). Instead of ditching weeks-worth of work that created the library (it's some of my best work, if I do say so myself) it was decided to utilize it for the new cross-poster, which itself became **Booski**, and the library became **Booski.Lib**.
>
> **Booski.Lib** is still being developed, as its used in other various personal projects, but it will never be considered truely stable or feature-complete. However, you are welcome to use it in your own projects (sorry, there's no NuGet package) and [submit tickets]([https://github.com/electricduck/booski/labels/Lib](https://github.com/electricduck/booski/issues/new)) (tagging with [Lib](https://github.com/electricduck/booski/labels/Lib)).
