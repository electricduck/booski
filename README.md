## ‚ú® Quick Start

>  This Quick Start makes general assumptions about your environment, such as using Linux (x86_64). For a more comprehensive guide, see [Docs](https://github.com/electricduck/booski/wiki).

```sh
cd ~/.local/bin
wget https://github.com/electricduck/booski/releases/download/v%2F0.x%2F0.4.5/booski-0.4.5-linux-x64.bin
chmod +x booski-0.4.5-linux-x64.bin
./booski-0.4.5-linux-x64.bin start --no-daemon
```

## üèóÔ∏è Building

This repository currently houses two tangentially related projects (under `./src`): the Bluesky cross-poster (`Booski`), and a general-purpose Bluesky library (`Booski.Lib`).

> For some background, Booski began life as a Bluesky library. Shortly into development, these plans folded as maitaining a library (especially for an ever-evolving unstable API) is a hard task at scale and [another, more feature-complete, Bluesky library already exists](https://github.com/drasticactions/FishyFlip). Instead of ditching weeks-worth of work that created the library (it's some of my best work, if I do say so myself) it was decided to utilize it for the new cross-poster, which itself became **Booski**, and the library became **Booski.Lib**.
>
> **Booski.Lib** is still being developed, as its used in other various personal projects, but it will never be considered truely stable or feature-complete. However, you are welcome to use it in your own projects (sorry, there's no NuGet package) and [submit tickets]([https://github.com/electricduck/booski/labels/Lib](https://github.com/electricduck/booski/issues/new)) (tagging with [Lib](https://github.com/electricduck/booski/labels/Lib)).

### Setting Up

#### Prerequisites

* **[.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/)**
   * [Version 9.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0) (and above) required. Due to [dotnet/runtime#72604](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/72604#issuecomment-1440708052), older versions are not supported.
* **Linux**, **Windows**, or **macOS**
* **Bash**
   * Scripts under `tools/bash/` require this shell. There are currently no native scripts for Windows/PowerShell.

#### Getting

```sh
git clone https://github.com/electricduck/booski.git
cd booski
git submodule sync
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

##### Future Pulls

When updating in the future, don't forget to update submodules with:

```
git submodule update --recursive
```

**Do not** use `git submodule foreach git pull`: this blindly updates all submodules to their latest version, not the commit this parent repo has checked out. This is important for some submodules that are checked out at specific tags/commits (such as `./lib/Telegram.Bot`).
